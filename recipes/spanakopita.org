#+title: Spanakopita!

Modified ever-so-slightly from [[https://smittenkitchen.com/2022/01/spanakopita/][this great recipe from Smitten Kitchen]].

- 20 oz. baby spinach, roughly chopped
- 1 red onion, finely chopped
- 6 scallions, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ⅓ c. chopped dill
- ⅓ c. chopped mint
- ½ c. chopped parsley
- 1 lb. feta, drained and crumbled
- 1 egg
- 1½ tsp. salt
- black pepper to taste (a teaspoon or two)
- 1 pound phyllo, defrosted
- ½--1 c. olive oil

Make sure your phyllo's defrosted (transferring it to the fridge overnight
works).

Preheat oven to 375°.

In your biggest bowl (I like this [[https://www.webstaurantstore.com/cambro-rfscw12135-camwear-12-qt-clear-round-food-storage-container/214RFSCW12.html][12 qt tub]], for context), combine spinach,
onion, scallions, garlic, herbs, feta, egg, and salt and pepper. Smoosh it all
together with your hands into a consistent green slurry. Yum!

Coat a 9"x13" baking pan (a 12" cast iron pan should work, too) with olive oil.

Lay 4--6 sheets of phyllo in the pan, leaving a significant portion hanging off
the sides. We'll be folding that back over once we've added the filling. Drizzle
with olive oil.

Rumple up 4--6 more sheets of phyllo into paddies and place them on the bottom.
Drizzle with olive oil.

Add half the filling.

Rumple up another 4--6 sheets of phyllo into paddies and place them over the
filling. This'll be the middle layer of phyllo. Drizzle with olive oil.

Add the rest of the filling.

Fold the hanging phyllo sheets back over the filling. Drizzle with olive oil.

Rumple up the remaining phyllo into paddies and cover the top. Drizzle with
olive oil. "Drizzling" is perfectly fine, but if you really want to break out a
pastry brush and get everything nicely coated in oil, now's the time.

Use a sharp, serrated knife to carefully cut the pie into portions (12 or 16
pieces, say). If you cut it now, /before/ baking, you won't shatter the crispy
sheets of phyllo when you serve it, and it'll look way better. Seriously, this
is critical.

Bake uncovered at 375° for 60 minutes.

Let sit 15 minutes before serving.
