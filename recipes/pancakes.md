# Pancakes

Makes about a dozen pancakes.

- 1 c. milk (or substitute 1 c. water)
- 1 large egg
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- 2 tbsp. sugar
- 2 tsp. baking powder
- ½ tsp. salt
- 1 c. flour

Mix everything in a mixing bowl and beat it all together. Add any extras---I
like about ¾ c. of sliced almonds and a sliced banana, but berries, pecans, or
chocolate chips would be great, too!

Spoon onto a griddle, cook until bubbly, then flip and cook for a couple more
minutes. Eat.
