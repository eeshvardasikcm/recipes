- 2 large cans any kind of bean, rinsed
- 2 tbsp. balsamic vinegar
- Bunch of kale, spinach, or chard, chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste

In a large pot, heat oil over medium. Add diced onions and cook 2 minutes to
soften. Add garlic and cook another minute. Add diced red peppers and cook 5
minutes, stirring often. Add canned tomatoes, continuing to cook and stir.

Add remaining ingredients. Stir, turn down heat, and simmer 20 minutes.

Remove bay leaves. Take a stick blender and roughly puree about â…“ of the pot
just to make it a bit smoother but leaving lots of chunks.
