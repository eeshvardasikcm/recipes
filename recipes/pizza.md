# Pizza

- 1 tsp. active dry yeast
- ¾ c. warm water
- 2 c. bread flour
- 1½ tsp. salt
- 3 tbsp. olive oil
- 1 c. [pizza sauce](pizza-sauce.md) (or pre-made pasta sauce with some extra
  garlic and oregano, in a pinch)
- ⅔ lb. mozzarella cheese
- ¼ lb. Parmesan cheese
- toppings, as desired

Combine yeast and warm water in a mixing bowl. Add salt and flour, mixing into a
rough dough. Knead dough for 5 minutes, roll it in a splash of olive oil, cover
in the bowl, and let rise for an hour.

Preheat oven to 500°.

Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper (or dust it with cornmeal).

Spread dough to fill the whole sheet, or until the dough is about ¼" thick.
Brush dough with olive oil: this adds flavor and crisps up the crust, so be sure
to brush all the way out to the edges. Sprinkling a bit of cornmeal on the oiled
edges of the crust adds some nice texture, too.

Cover in sauce, mozzarella, Parmesan, and any toppings you'd like. Bake for 8–10
minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Let cool for a couple minutes, cut,
and serve.
