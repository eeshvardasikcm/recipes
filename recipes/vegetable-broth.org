#+title: Vegetable Broth

- Big tub of frozen vegetable scraps (half a gallon or so)
- Couple bay leaves
- Pinch of thyme
- Pinch of rosemary

Here's the deal: keep a big bin of frozen vegetable scraps in your freezer.
Every time you peel some carrots or chop an onion, just add the scraps to the
bin.

Once you've got a critical mass of frozen vegetable scraps, simmer them in your
biggest stockpot with some herbs for a couple of hours, strain the solids out
with a colander, and hey presto, you've got vegetable broth!

Certain vegetables /shouldn't/ be saved for broth. For example, eggplant scraps
turn your broth purple and add a bitter taste. Jalape√±o seeds would be a
terrible addition for obvious reasons. Think it through.
