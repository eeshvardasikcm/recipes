#+title: Samosas

This is the recipe for the vegetable samosas from Rafiki's Deli at Lancaster,
PA's Central Market, courtesy of an old copy of the Lancaster newspaper.

/For the filling:/

- 1 tbsp. vegetable oil
- ½ tsp. cumin/mustard/sesame seed mixture
- 1 tbsp. cumin/coriander powder
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp. fresh cilantro leaves, chopped
- 1 tbsp. lemon juice
- ½ tsp. salt
- pinch of hot red pepper
- 3 medium potatoes, boiled, peeled, and cut into tiny pieces
- ¼ c. frozen peas
- ¼ c. cooked lentils

/For the dough:/

- 2 c. white flour
- 2½ tbsp. vegetable oil
- 1½ tbsp. rice flour
- ½ tsp. salt

Mix dough ingredients in a bowl and add water gradually (about ¼ c.) until it
holds together. Knead well, roll into a ball, cover with a moist cloth, and set
aside for about 20 min.

Meanwhile, heat oil and seeds in a skillet until the seeds pop. Add the onion
and saute until it becomes translucent.

Add lemon juice, cumin/coriander, salt, and pepper, and saute a few minutes.

Add potatoes, peas, and lentils. Mix and saute until just heated through.

Roll dough into 6" to 8" circles. Cut circles in half.

Fold half-circles into thirds and pinch into a cone. Fill the cones ⅔ full of
filling, then moisten the lip of the cone with water and pinch to seal. Squeeze
to remove air pockets. Flute the sealed edge, if possible.

Cover with a moist cloth until ready, then fry in hot oil until golden brown.
