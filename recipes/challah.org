Makes two loaves.

- 1 tsp. active dry yeast
- 2½ c. warm water
- ½ c. honey
- 4 tbsp. vegetable oil
- 3 eggs
- 1 tbsp. salt
- 8 c. bread flour
- 2 tbsp. sesame seeds

Combine yeast and water in a large mixing bowl. Stir in oil, salt, honey, and 2
eggs. Add flour, one cup at a time, and knead until smooth.

Cover with a damp cloth and let rise for an hour or two.

Preheat oven to 375°.

Split dough in half and knead each half for 5 minutes. Split each half into
three parts, roll them into long rolls, and braid together into two loaves.
Prepare two baking sheets with parchment paper and place loaves on sheets.

Mix up the last egg with a tablespoon or so of water to make an egg wash. Brush
the egg wash onto the loaves, getting into all the nooks and crannies. Sprinkle
each loaf with sesame seeds.

Bake for 40 minutes.
