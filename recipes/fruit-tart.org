Adapted from the /Better Homes and Gardens/ cookbook.

- One [[file:pie-crust.org][pie crust]] (the smaller, shell/tart-sized one)
- 1 lb. fruit, peeled and sliced (see below)
- ¼ c. sugar
- 4 tsp. flour
- ¼ tsp. nutmeg
- 1 tbsp. lemon juice
- 1 egg
- Some powdered sugar for decoration
- [[file:whipped-cream.org][Whipped cream]] (optional, but /highly/ recommended)

Preheat oven to 375°.

Prepare pie crust.

Line a baking sheet with foil. Roll out pie crust on top into a 13" circle.

Mix sugar, flour, and nutmeg; stir in fruit and lemon juice.

Pile the mixture in the center of the crust, leaving a 2" border.

Fold border up over fruit filling, pleating to fit.

Make an egg wash by beating the egg together with 1 tbsp. water. Brush the crust
with the egg wash.

Bake for 30 minutes. Remove and wrap some aluminum foil around the edges of the
crust to prevent browning. Bake another 15 minutes.

Cool on sheet for 30 minutes. Dust crust with powdered sugar.

/Fruits that work well:/

- 4 peaches, peeled and sliced. To make them easier to peel, cut a little =X= on
  the skin, boil them for about 30 seconds, then let them cool in ice water. The
  skin should come right off.
- 4 nectarines, sliced. Peeling's optional and not strictly necessary.
- A pound of strawberries.
- 4 baking apples (like Granny Smiths), peeled and sliced. Maybe add ½ tsp.
  cinnamon to the filling, too.
- 1 big Peruvian mango /or/ 2--3 smaller Alfonso mangoes. Mixing in \approx{}½ c. of
  blueberries might be a nice addition, too.
