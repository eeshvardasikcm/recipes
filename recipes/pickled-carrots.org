#+title: Pickled Carrots

- 1 tsp. black peppercorns
- ½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
- ½ tsp. allspice
- 1 c. rice vinegar
- 1 c. water
- ⅓ c. granulated sugar
- 1 tbsp. kosher salt
- 1 lb. carrots, cut into sticks
- 2 cloves garlic

Toast peppercorns, red pepper, and allspice over low-to-medium heat until
fragrant.

Add vinegar, water, sugar, and salt. Bring to a boil until sugar is dissolved.

Pack carrot sticks and garlic into a couple sterilized jars (I use two
pint-sized jars, but a quart jar would work, too). Add liquid.

Seal jar and refrigerate.
