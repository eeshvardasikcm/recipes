#+title: Scallion Pancakes

- 2 c. all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp. salt
- ¾ c. boiling water
- ½ c. cold water
- ¼ c. vegetable oil
- 1 bunch scallions, minced

Mix flour and salt together in a large bowl. Pour in boiling water and mix
together until combined. Work cold water, about 1 tbsp. at a time, into mixture
just until dough forms.

Knead dough for 10 minutes.

Cover bowl with damp cloth and let rest for 40 minutes.

Divide dough into 4 equal pieces on floured surface.

Roll each piece of dough into a large thin round. Brush the top with vegetable
oil and sprinkle with a quarter of the green onions. Roll the circle into a
scroll, then coil up the scroll into a snail-shell shape. Let sit for a few
minutes, then powder with flour and roll flat (to about ½").

To cook immediately, heat vegetable oil in a skillet, add a round, and cook
until golden brown (3 minutes or so). Repeat as desired with remaining rounds.

Alternatively, these freeze well! Stack separated with parchment paper.
