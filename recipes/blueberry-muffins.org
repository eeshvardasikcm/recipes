#+title: Blueberry Muffins

Makes about a dozen full-size muffins.

- 2½ c. all-purpose flour
- 1 tbsp. baking powder
- ½ tsp. baking soda
- ½ tsp. salt
- 1 stick butter, melted
- 1 c. sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1½ c. plain sour cream
- 2 tbsp. milk (vanilla almond milk works great!)
- 1 tsp. vanilla
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 1½ c. blueberries, fresh or frozen

Preheat oven to 400°. Line muffin tin cups with liners (or grease the cups
/thoroughly;/ this batter is a bit sticky).

Toss berries with a little flour. This keeps them from sticking together and
from sinking in the baking muffin.

Mix dry ingredients: flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt. Whisk together.

Mix wet ingredients separately: sour cream, sugar, eggs, milk, melted butter,
lemon zest, and vanilla.

Gradually add dry ingredients to wet, until just incorporated. Fold in
blueberries.

Fill up the muffin cups. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
