#+title: Roasted Potatoes

- 2 lb. small new potatoes, scrubbed clean, dried, and diced
- 2 tbsp. olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

Heat oven to 425°.

Place the potatoes on an aluminum foil–lined baking sheet, and toss with the
oil. Season the potatoes generously with salt and pepper, and place them in the
oven.

Bake potatoes, tossing occasionally with tongs, until they are golden brown and
crusty and can be easily pierced with the blade of a knife, about 20 to 25
minutes.

Remove potatoes from the oven, and transfer them to a large serving bowl or
platter. Season potatoes with more salt and pepper before serving.
