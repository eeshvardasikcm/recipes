#+title: Bran Muffins

- 1 c. wheat bran
- 1 c. oat bran
- 1 c. whole wheat flour
- 2 tsp. baking powder
- 1 tsp. baking soda
- ½ tsp. cinnamon
- 2 large ripe bananas, mashed
- 2 egg whites, lightly beaten
- ½ c. skim milk (nut milks are fine)
- 2 tbsp. olive oil
- squirt of honey

Line muffin pan with paper liners & preheat oven to 400°. Combine all dry
ingredients. In separate bowl, combine liquid ingredients. Mix all together
until just combined. Scoop by ¼ cups into pan. Bake 14-16 minutes or until
toothpick comes out sticky but clean. These really do not rise. I fill the cups
and just cook a little longer.

Can add fresh berries, chopped fruits and nuts. Granola. Try adding dried
cranberries---substitute orange juice for milk.
