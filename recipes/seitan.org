#+title: Seitan

Makes about one pound.

- 1 c. vital wheat gluten
- 3 tbsp. nutritional yeast
- ½ c. cold vegetable broth
- ¼ c. soy sauce
- 1 tbsp. olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves, pressed

- 2 qt. vegetable broth (or 3 bouillon cubes in water)
- ¼ c. soy sauce

Mix gluten and nutritional yeast.

Combine ½ c. vegetable broth, ¼ c. soy sauce, olive oil, and garlic.

Pour wet into dry and stir to combine. Knead by hand until elastic, about 3
minutes.

Cut into 3 approximately equal blobs.

Fill a stockpot with 2 qt. broth and other ¼ c. soy sauce. Add wheat gluten
pieces. Cover, just bring to a boil, then immediately lower to a simmer (a
rolling boil will make it spongy, so avoid that).

Partially cover and simmer for 1 hour, turning pieces occasionally.

Remove pieces and cool in a strainer until cool enough to handle.

Slice and use immediately, or store marinated in the cooking juice.
