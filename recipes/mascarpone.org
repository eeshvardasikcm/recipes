#+title: Mascarpone

- 2 c. heavy cream
- 3 tbsp. lemon juice
- 1 tsp. cream of tartar

Set up a double boiler (or just float a metal mixing bowl in a large saucepan of
water) on medium-high heat.

Add cream to bowl. Heat until warm.

Whisk in lemon juice and cream of tartar. Stir and continue heating until
temperature reaches about 180Â°.

While heating, line a colander with cheesecloth (a couple of moist paper towels
work, too). Once the mix is hot enough, pour it into the strainer.

Chill in the refrigerator overnight, then spoon into a container. Ought to be
good for about a week.
