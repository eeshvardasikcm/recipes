#+title: Crepes

- 1 c. all-purpose flour
- 2 eggs
- ½ c. milk
- ½ c. water
- ¼ tsp. salt
- 2 tbsp. butter, melted

Whisk all ingredients together in a mixing bowl until smooth.

Heat a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add ¼ c. of batter, tilting
the pan in a circle to thinly spread the batter.

Cook until it turns golden-brown and holds together easily, about 2 minutes.
Loosen, flip, and cook the other side.

You can fill these with just about anything (or just serve them plain, with a
little butter and powdered sugar). We've tried and enjoyed:

- [[file:mascarpone.org][mascarpone]] and berries,
- apple pie filling,
- sautéed mushrooms and spinach, with some black pepper and thyme, and
- black beans, salsa, and cheddar.
