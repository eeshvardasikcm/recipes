#+title: Mandazis

 - 1 c. milk (almond works well)
- ¼ c. vegetable oil
- ¼ c. sugar
- 1 egg
- 2 tsp. instant yeast
- ½ tsp. salt
- 1 tsp. cardamom
- 3 ½ c. flour

Mix together all ingredients, flour last.

Knead for a couple of minutes. Add a bit more flour if the dough feels
especially sticky.

Let dough sit, covered, for an hour.

Divide dough into four equal balls.

Roll each ball out into a circle about ⅓" thick. Divide into eighths, like a
pizza.

Deep-fry each wedge of dough in oil until puffed up and golden brown.

Serve with jam or honey.
